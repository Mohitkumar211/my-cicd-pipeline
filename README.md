# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**. It is designed to help students and beginners understand the workflow, tools, and best practices involved in automating software build, test, and deployment processes.

## What is CI/CD?

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of frequently merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline. It involves automatically building, testing, and verifying changes to ensure the codebase remains healthy.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes the CI process to production or staging environments. This reduces manual interventions and speeds up release cycles.

## Key Technologies

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform integrated with GitHub, allowing you to create custom workflows that build, test, and deploy your code right from your GitHub repository. It enables robust CI/CD pipelines with ease and flexibility.

### Docker

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into containers. These containers ensure consistency across multiple environments such as development, testing, and production.

## How This CI/CD Pipeline Works

The pipeline in this project performs the following steps automatically whenever code is pushed to the repository:

1. **Checkout Code**: The workflow pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Build Docker Image**: Docker builds an image of the application using the `Dockerfile` found in the repo.
3. **Run Tests**: The image is used to run unit or integration tests inside a container.
4. **Push Docker Image**: If tests pass, the pipeline pushes the Docker image to a Docker registry (like Docker Hub).
5. **Deploy Application**: Optionally, the pipeline triggers a deployment process such as deploying to a cloud service or updating a server.

## Prerequisites

Before running or modifying this pipeline, you should have:

- A GitHub account and basic understanding of Git/GitHub.
- Docker installed on your machine (for local testing).
- A Docker Hub account or access to a Docker registry (if pushing images).
- Basic knowledge of YAML syntax (for understanding GitHub Actions workflows).
- A sample application code and a `Dockerfile` to containerize it.

## Running and Testing the Pipeline

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
